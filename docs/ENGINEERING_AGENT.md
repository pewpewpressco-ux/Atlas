# Atlas Engineering Agent Layer

## Purpose

Atlas will eventually include an autonomous engineering capability that can safely modify, validate, and evolve the platform while preserving repository integrity.

The Engineering Agent is not a replacement for Atlas. It is an operational layer that applies Atlas governance principles to software development.

---

## Design Principles

The Engineering Agent follows:

- GitHub as source of truth
- evidence-driven changes
- immutable change records where possible
- deterministic validation
- controlled promotion
- human/governance approval before production changes

---

## Target Architecture

```
Human Owner
    |
    v
Atlas Engineering Agent
    |
    +-- Repository Understanding
    +-- Planning
    +-- Implementation
    +-- Testing
    +-- Review
    +-- Commit / Pull Request
    |
    v
GitHub Repository
```

## Engineering Change Lifecycle

Future software changes should become governed artifacts:

```
DRAFT
  |
RESEARCH
  |
VALIDATION
  |
TESTING
  |
REVIEW
  |
MERGED
  |
PRODUCTION
```

---

## Required Components

Future implementation should include:

```
framework/engineering/

repository_agent.py
planning_agent.py
coding_agent.py
test_agent.py
review_agent.py
```

---

## Git Governance

The Engineering Agent must not directly modify production branches.

Preferred workflow:

```
main
 |
feature branch
 |
implementation
 |
tests
 |
evidence artifact
 |
review
 |
merge
```

---

## Relationship To Artifact Framework

The Artifact Framework is the foundation for autonomous engineering governance.

Code changes should eventually produce EngineeringChange artifacts containing:

- requested change
- affected modules
- implementation evidence
- test results
- diff integrity
- review history
- parent commit relationship

---

## Current Status

Planning stage.

Immediate priority remains completion of Artifact Framework validation migration.

After validator migration, design and implementation of the Engineering Agent layer can begin.
